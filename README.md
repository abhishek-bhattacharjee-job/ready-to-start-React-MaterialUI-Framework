# Ready-to-Start React-MaterialUI Framework

This is a UI code base using - Material UI - integrated into React.

## 1. When this could be usefull?

You want to start a new project develpoment work using React and Material UI.

## 2. Why this repo?

Several times I have seen people are spending much times for initial setup while starting development for a new project.

And also we tend to forget things we do before starting actual development,
we had to go to the react and material sites and recall what to do for integrating material into react.

Some times I have seen people copying previous project's code for quick start - this could lead data breach of the previous project.

## 3. What you would get in this repo?

1. You would get a Ready-to-Start React code base
2. Material UI is integrated into this React code base
3. A Login page
4. Integrated Header, Footer and Sidebar
5. Some pages with Matrial ui structure, which you can copy and use and leverage
6. A page with a background Image
7. A page with a Material Tablestructure
Etc.
